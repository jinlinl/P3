	<h2> project summary </h2>
	<p>
	This project was the final group project of the term in IAT 233: Spatial Design. It built upon the Seattle Charrette project, and required teams
	to iterate and improve upon the elements from the previous project based on the feedback received previously.
	</p>

	<h2> intention </h2>
	<p>
	Once again, my role in the team was the art director and graphic designer.
	From our previous presentation, we received the feedback that certain geometric elements of our design did not unify well with our concept of fluidity. As a result, we slightly altered our previous concept, the chaotic fluidity of life, to utilize a physical representation, namely tidal waves. Doing this allowed us to more powerfully portray and convey our concept by moving from an abstract idea to a physical representation. Tidal waves also contain geometry in their ragged shape, thus fitting
	more appropriately with our composition and geometric elements in our design, such as image boxes. Crashing waves also intended to visually depict intertwining relationships. Thus, the art direction aimed to convey strength yet beauty as seen in the crashing of waves. This was translated into strong contrast between black and white, while incorporating the serenity of blue. Grace was also conveyed in the delicate font which allowed for breathability via use of kerning and leading.
	</p>

	<h2> results and challenges </h2>
	<p>
	Despite the challenge of determining the elements that should be kept or changed, the project ultimately received praise for being able to
	wisely and successfully apply the feedback given previously in order to improve. Our greatest challenge was building our physical model due to the difficulty of utilizing spatial thinking and creativity to create a form that was unique and interesting. It was also difficult to create strong cohesion between the model and the design. Particularly, in this project our team members were assigned specific tasks. Thus, as the art director and graphic designer, I had to effectively and clearly communicate with the copy writer and the model constructors to convey my concept. In situations where there was confusion about the concept and each members' vision, I needed to understand where the miscommunication occured and produce new ways of explaining. However, we managed to create unity within our various elements by communicating effectively and employing the same design intentions and moodboard to each piece of the project. We further devised of subtle and subconscious methods of building unity, such as having a textured paper background on our slides and having portions of textured paper within our model.
