	<h1> INFORMATION GRID </h1>
	<h2> project summary </h2>
	<p>
	This project was a team project for the class IAT 233: Spatial Design. Groups were assigned a famous architect and their building- ours being Zaha Hadid's Vitra Fire Station- and were required to research in order to describe the architect's key principles, as well as create a model of the building. As the art director and graphic designer, I took on the leader
	role in order to create cohesion between all aspects of the project. Thus, although my primary focus was in design, I assisted in building, research and copy-writing as well. 
	</p>

	<h2> intention </h2>
	<p>
	The art direction for this project intended to promote Zaha Hadid’s non-conforming ideology and geometric, bold approach. It simultaneously aimed to recreate the aesthetic and sophisticated mood of her designs.
	These decisions were intended to promote the feeling of movement and flow in the spread, similar to Hadid’s work. The use of thin fonts and all-capital titles were incorporated in order to emulate this mood. This was also represented in the monochromatic color scheme, which reflects her frequently used materials- concrete, steel and glass. 
	</p>

	<h2> feedback </h2>
	<p>
	Although our outcome was successful, our group was encouraged to take a bolder, riskier approach. Thus, this was implemented in our second version of the grid.
	</p>

	<h2> intention </h2>
	<p>
	Therefore we decided to experiment with a diagonal composition to enhance Hadid’s non-parallel form. We intended to utilize aspects of suprematism such as geometric shapes and minimal embellishments in our designs. As a result we were inspired by Swiss typographic design which shares characteristics with suprematism; we aimed to implement its use of leading lines, angles and the subsequent dynamism, as well as its use of impactful typography. 
	</p>

	<h2> result and challenge </h2>
	<p>
	The second version was also ultimately met with positive feedback, as it accurately portrayed our intended theme of dynamism and movement while taking a bolder approach. This project allowed me to push the boundaries as to what I believed should be done in design and thus created a growing experience. As the art director, the greatest challenge was coordinating the tasks of all 5 group members and ensuring understanding of the task and quality control. However, this was able to be accomplished and thus allowed for a successful project.
