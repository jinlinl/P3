	<h1>MAGAZINE SPREAD</h1>
	
	<h2> project summary </h2>
	<p>
	This project was the second project in the class IAT 233: Spatial Design in which students were required to art direct, design and photograph for a fashion magazine spread, beginning with a moodboard using Adobe software, particularly Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. 
	</p>

	<h2> intention </h2>
	<p>
	For this project, I intended to create a magazine spread regarding geometric shapes and silhouettes in fashion. To suit and reflect the high contrast and elegance of the Bodoni font, I intended to develop a minimalistic, angular and sleek theme. Thus I dressed my model in geometric, boxy but flowy clothing with one main article that contrasted the rest of the outfit. I chose locations that had rougher textures and opposing colors to contrast the clothing. As well, I chose minimalistic backgrounds that contained interesting angles and shapes. I further intended to reflect high-fashion and elegant poses in my photographs.
	I then aimed to utilize those angles and shapes in my photographs in my composition in order to promote a strong underlying grid structure.
	I attempted to give the spread a generous amount of white space in order to support the theme of minimalism, and chose photos that contrasted for each spread.
	</p>

	<h2> challenges </h2>
	<p>
	As with all projects in this class, each project was to be completed within a week and thus, difficulty lay in creating an efficient and successful schedule. I also needed to contact a model and arrange a day to hold a photoshoot so it was crucial that I was prepared beforehand in order to allow for a smooth process.Thus, I carefully planned the upcoming week; I listed all the tasks that needed to be completed and the approximate time needed for their completion. As a result of creating a fast-paced and well-considered schedule of tasks to complete daily and following that schedule, I was able to complete the task in a timely manner while meeting my own expectations as to quality. There were also issues of competing visual weights on either side of the page which I was able to adequately combat, however in future iterations that would be an aspect I improve upon as my level of knowledge has increased. 
	</p>

	<h2> result </h2>
	<p>
	From this project, I received praise from my professor for my design and ability to art direct and unify all aspects of the project, and thus prompted my interest in design and confidence as a designer. This project taught me key principles of graphic design that I continue to implement currently and on all future projects, such as composition and the importance of white space, as well as how to create a cohesive mood and tone. As this project required photography, I also learned
	the key elements involved in creating a particular tone through photographs and to correlate the mood of photographs to the mood of a design.
