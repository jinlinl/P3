			<h2> project summary </h2>
			<p>
			This project was part of the class IAT 233: Spatial Design. 
			It required art direction, design and photography for a fashion magazine spread, beginning with a moodboard. 
			The project was completed using Adobe software, particularly Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

			<h2> intention </h2>
			<p>
			For this project, I intended to create a magazine spread regarding geometric shapes and silhouettes 
			in fashion. To suit and reflect the high contrast and elegance of the Bodoni font, I developed a 
			minimalistic, angular and sleek theme. Thus I dressed my model in geometric, boxy but loose-fitting 
			clothing with one article that contrasted the rest of the outfit. I chose locations that had rough 
			textures and opposing colors to further contrast the clothing. As well, I chose minimalistic 
			backgrounds that contained interesting angles and shapes. Also, I aimed to reflect high-fashion, 
			elegant poses in my photographs. I then utilized the angles and shapes in my photographs in my 
			design composition in order to promote a strong grid structure. White space was promoted in order 
			to reflect my theme of minimalism.

			<h2> challenges </h2>
			<p>
				This project was to be completed within a week and thus, difficulty lay in creating an efficient and 
				successful schedule and following through with it. Because of that, I needed to contact a model and arrange 
				a day to hold a photoshoot, so it was crucial that I was prepared beforehand in order to allow for a smooth 
				process.Thus, I carefully planned the upcoming week; I listed all the tasks that needed to be completed and 
				the approximate time needed for their completion. As a result of creating a fast-paced and well-considered 
				schedule of tasks to complete daily and following that schedule, I was able to complete the task in a timely 
				manner while meeting my own expectations as to quality. There were also issues of competing visual weights 
				on either side of the page which I was able to adequately combat, 
				however in future iterations that would be an aspect I improve upon as my level of design knowledge increases.

			<h2> result </h2>
			<p>
			I received praise from my professor for my design and ability to art direct and unify all aspects of 
			the project. This project prompted my interest in design and confidence as a designer. It taught me 
			key principles of graphic design that I continue to implement on all design work, such as composition 
			and the importance of white space, as well as how to create a cohesive mood and tone. As this project 
			required photography, I also learned the key elements involved in creating a particular tone through
			photographs and to unify the mood of photographs and the mood of the composition.
