	<h2> about </h2>
	<p>
	I am Jin Lin, a student at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology with concentrations in design and
	media arts. Raised with a love for the arts, I aspire to create work that transcends the use of words to communicate and convey 
	emotions. 
	As a student in an interdisciplinary school, I have developed skills and programs in a variety of fields such as coding in 
	Javascript, HTML and CSS, design through Illustrator and media arts in Photoshop, Maya, Adobe Creative Cloud.
	
	With competence in a variety of 
	aspects of design and media arts, as well as strong critical thinking, I am able to contribute 
	to several elements of a design project and create cohesive projects as an art director.
