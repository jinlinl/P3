			<p>
			I believe that art has the power to transcend the use of verbal communication to convey meaning and emotions.
			In my life, I aspire to create work that does just that, and am currently in pursuit.<br><br>
			
			Raised with a love for the arts, I am a third student at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology, pursuing a B.A with concentrations in design and media arts. As a student with drive and a passion to learn, I entered an interdisciplinary school in order to developed skills in an abundance of areas. Through my time at SIAT I have gained expertise in areas such as animation, cinematography, coding, design, photography, and more. 
			As a result, I have also had a vast amount of practise with programs such as Adobe Creative Cloud software like Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Maya, and coding languages like Javascript, HTML and CSS. My years at SIAT have also allowed me to develop strong teamwork skills, and I have gained much experience and comfortability in leadership. <br><br>

			With competence in a variety of aspects of design and media arts, as well as strong critical thinking and interpersonal skills, I am able to contribute to the various elements that comprise a design project. 
			Thus in my career, I aim to become an art director or have a similar leadership position. I am currently in pursuit of a co-op position to immerse myself in a design environment and learn from various experts in the field. <br><br>
