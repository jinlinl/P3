			<p>
			I am Jin Lin, a student at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology with concentrations in design and
			media arts. Raised with a love for the arts, I aspire to create work that transcends the use of words to communicate and convey 
			emotions. <br><br>
			
			As a student in an interdisciplinary school, I have developed skills and programs in a variety of fields such as coding in 
			Javascript, HTML and CSS, design through Illustrator and Indesign, and media arts in Photoshop, Maya, Adobe Creative Cloud.
			With competence in a variety of aspects of design and media arts, as well as strong critical thinking, I am able to contribute 
			to several elements of a design project and create cohesive projects as an art director. <br><br>

			I am currently seeking a co-op position, and would ultimately like to work a creative job that allows me to directly use my design and art skills
			in order to create visual pieces. <br><br>
			<br>

			If you would like to get in touch with me, I can be reached at <strong> jinlinl@sfu.ca <strong>.
