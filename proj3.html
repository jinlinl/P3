	<h2> project summary </h2>
	<p>
	This project was a team project for IAT 233: Spatial Design. It required students to devise and execute on a concept and build a form within 5 days, which proved to be the biggest challenge faced during the project. Teams then competed in a design charrette competition in Seattle via presentation of their idea infront of the professor, senior mentors and fellow peers. 
	</p>

	<h2> intention </h2>
	<p>
	As this project required strict job assignment for each member, my focus was on visual design. This entailed the creation of an art direction, photographing our model and editing those photo and slide deck design. Our concept intended to convey the complex yet fluid paths in life, creating a form that emphasized the moments of fateful intersection. Thus my art direction aimed to convey an elegant, serene yet strong tone. It combined curvilinear and rectilinear shapes to translate the fluidity of life, and used hints of blue to portray tranquility and mysticism. The use of a dark background and white font provided boldness and contract. Meanwhile, elegance was also reflected in the use of a delicate, airy sans serif font.

	<h2> results and challenges </h2>
	<p>
	Ultimately, our slide deck was praised for its intelligent use of design principles and typography. This allowed us to place in the top 5 of the charrette competition. As this project required teams to develop their own concept and art direct it with a slide deck and form, the project allowed me to improve my art directing skills by coordinating an overall tone across various mediums, from a physical model to a digital slide deck. It also proved to be a test of my ideation and design skills as this was the shortest amount of time in which I needed to create a meaningful design. The time constraint was the largest challenge we faced, particularly being able to conceive of a robust and quality concept within a few days. We were able to do so because of our ability to rapidly brainstorm as a group while maintaining a respectful environment. I largely attribute the success of our group to each members' ability to be organized, courteous, professional, driven and empathetic.
